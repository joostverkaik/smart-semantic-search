# smart-semantic-search
Welcome to group 16's Semantic Web Final Project for academic year 2016/2017.
We developed an application for the modern day nomads that want to find a city to go to and work there.
The users can set filters to find the perfect place and instantly see scores like LGBT friendliness, prices of coffee, beer, et cetera, and view accommodations and places to work.
Included is the source code, Stardog data and experimental files.
